<p>it's a python program that can sort your files in different folders (pdf,images,videos,apps)</p>
<h1>How it works</h1>
<ul>
    <li>firstly,you will be asked to  put the full path of the desired location that will do all the work to sort the files</li>
    <li>secondly,you will be asked to put a destination where the files will be stored sorted</li>
    <li>thirdly,you put random files int the first path and by magic the work is done</li>
</ul>
